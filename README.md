# Virtual-Notepad

## Project Description

Digital painting is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as watercolor, oils, impasto etc are applied using digital tools by means of a computer ,a graphics tablet , stylus and software. With the advent of new sensing technologies, touch free-air interaction is becoming viable as a contender for the next generation of expressive, embodied interaction modes. Virtual Notepad is a hands-free digital drawing canvas for creating, recognizing and visualizing documents in air. This project is based on the concept of image processing and computer vision. It works on the principle that converts the hand movements in air, which are captured by a webcam, into a sequence of x, y coordinates on a 2D Cartesian plane, and visualizes them on a white canvas. Virtual Notepad can be used in highly sophisticated environments like a smart classroom, a smart factory or a smart laboratory, where it would enable people to annotate pieces of texts wherever they want without any reference surface.

## Objective

The primary objective of Virtual Notepad was to draw on air and to innovate the idea of writing along with smooth drawing and fast responsive output. It is designed in such a way to make it more appealing by adding features like vibrant choices of colors to let the user be more creative and screenshot features to save and share the notes quickly and easily.

## Applications

● **Cheap Solution for education purposes**: As the world is advancing towards a more technologically dependent era and the way of learning is also becoming more digital, but due to financial restraints every school or college can't afford tablets for each student so this could be a great alternative to that .

● **Fun and interactive way of learning**: Due to the corona pandemic we are forced to stay indoors and all the colleges and schools have been working online and due to which sometimes students find it hard to concentrate on the screen and also feel bored. So the idea of a virtual notepad will be a more interactive way of learning.

● **Also used in various fields like 3 - D Modelling and Virtual reality**

## Conclusion

We envision Virtual Notepad to be used in a smart classroom environment using augmented reality, where people can scribble anything as air notes and visualize
these notes in the form of handwriting, thus giving the process of creating a new definition.

With Virtual Notepad, we have achieved a hands-free drawing program that uses OpenCV to detect the user’s pointer finger. Colorful lines can be drawn wherever the
user desires and the brush can even be modified. It is truly like drawing in the air! Virtual Notepad can be modified by adding a handwriting recognition feature to it
using Natural Language Processing to detect characters.
